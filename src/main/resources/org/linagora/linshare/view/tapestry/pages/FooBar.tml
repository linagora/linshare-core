        <h1>Fine Uploader Demo</h1>

        <div id="examples">
            <div class="example">
                <h3>Simple and Automatic</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the Fine Uploader with only required options set.  Note that, by default, you may also drag and drop
                    files onto the button if you are using a browser that supports the multiple attribute on input elements, and
                    the File and FormData objects, as well as the upload function on the XHR object.  This currently rules out
                    at least IE 9 and earlier.
                </p>
                <ul id="basicUploadSuccessExample" class="unstyled"></ul>
            </div>
            <div class="example">
                <h3>Manually Trigger Uploads</h3>
                <p>
                    The default behavior of Fine Uploader is to immediately attempt to upload files as they are selected.
                    One option allows you to simply queue all files, and then start uploading at a later time by calling
                    <code>uploadStoredFiles()</code> on your Fine Uploader instance.
                </p>
                <ul id="manualUploadModeExample" class="unstyled"></ul>
                <span id="triggerUpload" class="btn btn-primary">Upload Queued Files</span>
            </div>
            <div class="example">
                <h3>See server failure messages</h3>
                <p>
                    If your server returns a response that includes a reason property, such as <code>{"success": false, "reason": "unsupported file type"}</code>
                    the error message is accessible in the UI by hovering over the failed upload item.
                </p>
                <ul id="basicUploadFailureExample" class="unstyled"></ul>
            </div>
            <div class="example">
                <h3>Various Options</h3>
                <p>
                    There are various options available to you when using Fine Uploader.  In this example, I've used a
                    small subset of these options to create an uploader with custom upload button text, restricted to one
                    file upload/selection at once (may not select multiple files), restricted to <code>jpeg</code>, <code>jpg</code>, and <code>txt</code> files,
                    and restricted to a max file size of 50 kb.
                </p>
                <ul id="uploadWithVariousOptionsExample" class="unstyled"></ul>
            </div>
            <div class="example">
                <h3>FineUploaderBasic</h3>
                <div id="fubUploadButton" class="btn btn-primary"><div>Select Files</div></div>
            </div>
